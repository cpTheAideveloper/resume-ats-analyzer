4. **Ask clarifying questions if needed:**
   "Before we start, do you have any specific requirements or constraints for this task?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR AI

### **ALWAYS DO:**
- ‚úÖ **Read the current phase status** - Understand what's being worked on
- ‚úÖ **Check project structure** - Know what exists and what's in progress  
- ‚úÖ **Follow established patterns** - Reuse components, follow conventions
- ‚úÖ **Respect restrictions** - Especially for styling-only work
- ‚úÖ **Ask for clarification** - If task or context is unclear

### **NEVER DO:**
- ‚ùå **Assume previous session knowledge** - Always work from provided files
- ‚ùå **Break core functionality** - Don't modify logic unless explicitly for development work
- ‚ùå **Add unauthorized features** - Only work on requested tasks
- ‚ùå **Ignore project conventions** - Follow the established patterns
- ‚ùå **Skip file requests** - Always get proper context first
